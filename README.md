Week 2 / Portfolio Assignment

## Introduction:

This application was built as a portfolio website by Chad Dowdall.
It displays sections to display my work, talk more about myself, and include my contact information.

click [here](https://cjgd99.github.io/portfolio-assignment/) to go to the web page.

## Installation:

You can obtain this code from my repository on github [here](https://github.com/CJGD99/portfolio-assignment).

Use the git clone command to clone this repo to your local directory and open in a code editor software to begin editing the code.

## Usage:

This application is intended to be used by myself. It is a place to upload my work to my portfolio and showcase it to potential employers. It has functioning links, which at the moment only have two uses: the nav bar is used to navigate the page, and the title links will take you to the MDN docs homescreen, which, as I add my own work will instead take you to the deployed applications that I've built.
